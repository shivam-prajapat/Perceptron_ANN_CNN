# 📊 Perceptron vs ANN vs CNN for Image Classification (MNIST)

This project demonstrates and compares three different neural network models for image classification:

• **Perceptron (Single-Layer Network)**  
• **ANN – Artificial Neural Network (Multi-Layer)**  
• **CNN – Convolutional Neural Network**  

The goal is to clearly show **why CNN performs best on image data** by comparing:
- Training Accuracy
- Training Loss
- Applied (Test) Accuracy
- Applied (Test) Loss

## 🧠 Models Used

### 1️⃣ Perceptron
A simple neural network with **no hidden layers**. It treats every pixel as a number and cannot learn spatial patterns.

### 2️⃣ ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
A multi-layer network with hidden layers. It learns better than a perceptron but still **flattens the image**, losing spatial structure.

### 3️⃣ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
A deep learning model designed for images. It uses **convolution and pooling layers** to learn edges, shapes, and textures.

## 🚀 What This Project Shows

✔ Comparison of model performance on **image data**  
✔ Why CNN generalizes better on unseen (test) data  
✔ Visual graphs for:
- Training Accuracy
- Training Loss
- Applied (Test) Accuracy
- Applied (Test) Loss

## 📈 Results Summary

| Model       | Test Accuracy | Test Loss |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Perceptron  | Low           | High      |
| ANN         | Medium        | Medium    |
| CNN         | High          | Low       |

➡️ **Conclusion:** CNN performs best for image classification tasks.
